# odmpy

A command line manager for OverDrive/Libby loans. Originally a python port of [overdrive](https://github.com/chbrown/overdrive), it now supports downloading of various loan types such as **audiobooks**, **eBooks**, and **magazines** via [Libby](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6103.htm).

odmpy also has useful features for audiobooks such as adding of chapters metadata and merging of multipart files into a single `.mp3` or `.m4b` (requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)).

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Requires Python >= 3.7.

## Features

1. Downloads the audio files for an audiobook loan, with additional options to:
   - merge files into a single `.mp3` or `.m4b` file
   - add chapters information into the audio file(s)
2. Download eBook (EPUB/PDF) loans as `.acsm` files or as `.epub` files (with `--direct`)
3. Download magazine loans as `.epub` files
4. Return or renew loans

## Install

You must already have [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) installed on your system. If you wish to use the merge feature for audiobooks, you will also need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

```bash
# Install / Update to specific version
python3 -m pip install git+https://git@github.com/ping/odmpy.git@0.7.8 --upgrade

# Install / Update from latest source
python3 -m pip install git+https://git@github.com/ping/odmpy.git --upgrade --force-reinstall

# Uninstall
python3 -m pip uninstall odmpy
```

## Usage

> ### ⚠️ Breaking
> 
> From version 0.7, the `--retry/-r` option has been moved to the base `odmpy` command (similar to `--timeout/-t`) for consistency
>  ```bash
>  # previously
>  odmpy dl --retry 3 "MyLoan.odm"
>  odmpy libby --retry 3
>
>  # now
>  odmpy --retry 3 dl "MyLoan.odm"
>  odmpy --retry 3 libby
>  ```

  --mergeformat {mp3,m4b}
                        Merged file format (m4b is slow, experimental, requires ffmpeg). For audiobooks.
  --mergecodec {aac,libfdk_aac}
                        Audio codec of merged m4b file. (requires ffmpeg, using libfdk_aac requires ffmpeg compiled with libfdk_aac support). For audiobooks. Has no effect if mergeformat is mp3.

                        Book folder format string. Default "%(Title)s - %(Author)s".
                        Available fields:
                          %(Title)s : Title
                          %(Author)s: Comma-separated Author names

  --bookfileformat BOOK_FILE_FORMAT
                        Book file format string (without extension). Default "%(Title)s - %(Author)s".
                        This applies to only merged audiobooks, ebooks, and magazines.
                        Available fields:

  --overwritetags       Always overwrite ID3 tags.
                        By default odmpy tries to non-destructively tag audiofiles.
                        This option forces odmpy to overwrite tags where possible. For audiobooks.
  --tagsdelimiter DELIMITER
                        For ID3 tags with multiple values, this defines the delimiter.
                        For example, with the default delimiter ";", authors are written
                        to the artist tag as "Author A;Author B;Author C". For audiobooks.
  --id3v2version {3,4}  ID3 v2 version. 3 = v2.3, 4 = v2.4
  --opf                 Generate an OPF file for the downloaded audiobook/magazine/ebook.
  -r OBSOLETE_RETRIES, --retry OBSOLETE_RETRIES
                        Obsolete. Do not use.
  -j, --writejson       Generate a meta json file (for debugging).
  --hideprogress        Hide the download progress bar (e.g. during testing).
  --direct              Process the download directly from Libby without 
                        downloading an odm/acsm file. For audiobooks/eBooks.
  --keepodm             Keep the downloaded odm and license files. For audiobooks.
  --latest N            Non-interactive mode that downloads the latest N number of loans.
  --select N [N ...]    Non-interactive mode that downloads loans by the index entered.
                        For example, "--select 1 5" will download the first and fifth loans in order of the checked out date.
                        If the 5th loan does not exist, it will be skipped.
  --selectid ID [ID ...]
                        Non-interactive mode that downloads loans by the loan ID entered.
                        For example, "--selectid 12345" will download the loan with the ID 12345.
                        If the loan with the ID does not exist, it will be skipped.
  --exportloans LOANS_JSON_FILEPATH
                        Non-interactive mode that exports loan information into a json file at the path specified.
  --reset               Remove previously saved odmpy Libby settings.
  --check               Non-interactive mode that displays Libby signed-in status and token if authenticated.
  --debug               Debug switch for use during development. Please do not use.
```

There are non-interactive options available:

- Export loans information to a json file
   ```bash
   # export current loans in json
   odmpy libby --exportloans "path/to/loans.json"
   ```
- Download the latest N number of loans in order of checkout
   ```bash
   # download latest checked out loan
   odmpy libby --latest 1
   ```
- Download selected loans
   ```bash
   # download 3rd and 5th loans in order of checkout
   odmpy libby --select 3 5
   ```

#### eBooks

_Experimental Feature_

Using the `--ebooks` option will allow you to download/return/renew EPUB/PDF eBook loans. Information about the different eBook formats available can be found [here](https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0012.html).

For EPUB/PDF DRM loans, `odmpy` will download an [`.acsm` file](https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0577.html) for use with [Adobe Digital Editions (ADE)](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6059.htm) by default.

For loans available as an "Open EPUB" or "Open PDF", the actual DRM-free `.epub`/`.pdf` book file will be downloaded. There is no option to download the `.acsm` file for open formats.

##### The `--direct` option

Using the `--direct` option with EPUB DRM loans will download the web Libby version of the eBook as an `.epub`. This is _different_ from the `.epub` that you get when you use an `.acsm` loan file with ADE.

This option is not recommended because the `.epub` downloaded may not work well with your reader. Use this as an alternative if you cannot use the `.acsm` file for whatever reason.

The `--direct` option does not affect PDF eBook loans. These will continue to be downloaded as `.acsm` or `.pdf`.

#### Magazines

_Experimental Feature_

Using the `--magazines` option will allow you to download/return/renew magazine loans.

Only magazines that have [readable individual articles](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6215.htm) can be downloaded. 

When downloading, `odmpy` will download the web Libby version of the magazine as an `.epub`. This is _different_ from the Libby app downloaded copy (for offline reading) and is usually smaller in file size.

While the magazine `.epub` has been tested to work reasonably well on an eInk Kindle (after conversion), Moon+ Reader (Android), iBooks (macOS), and [calibre viewer](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/viewer.html), how well the `.epub` works will depend on your reading device and the magazine contents.

It is recommended that you use a different book folder and file format for magazine. For example:
```bash
# file will be downloaded as './National Geographic/National Geographic-Jan 01 2023.epub"
odmpy libby --magazines --downloaddir "./" --bookfolderformat "%(Title)s" --bookfileformat "%(Title)s-%(Edition)s"
```

#### Unable to download odm files?

OverDrive no longer shows the odm download links for macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and newer.
There are many ways to get around this but the easiest for me was to use a 
[bookmarklet](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks).
Follow the instructions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/ping/b58ae66359691db1d08f929a9e57a03d)
to get started.

Alternatively, if you have switched over to Libby, `odmpy` now
supports direct from Libby downloads through the `libby` command.

```bash
# view available options
odmpy libby -h
```

</details>

<details><summary>Return an .odm</summary>

```
usage: odmpy ret [-h] odm_file

Return an audiobook loan file (odm).

positional arguments:
  odm_file    ODM file path.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

</details>

<details><summary>Information about an .odm</summary>

```
usage: odmpy info [-h] [-f {text,json}] odm_file

Get information about an audiobook loan file (odm).

positional arguments:
  odm_file              ODM file path.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f {text,json}, --format {text,json}
                        Format for output.
```

</details>

[`.odm`](https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0577.html) files have to be downloaded from your library's OverDrive site and are meant for use with OverDrive's [now legacy app](https://company.overdrive.com/2021/08/09/important-update-regarding-libby-and-the-overdrive-app/).


### Examples

```bash

# Start the Libby interface to select an audiobook loan to download
# The `libby` command shares almost all of the download options as `dl`
# Example, downloads will be saved in MyLoans/
odmpy libby -d "MyLoans/"

# View and download ebook (EPUB) loans as `.acsm` files
odmpy libby --ebooks

# View and download magazines loans as `.epub` files
odmpy libby --magazines

# Download via Libby without generating the odm file
odmpy libby --direct

# Download via Libby your latest loan non-interactively
odmpy libby --direct --latest 1

# Return loans via Libby
odmpy libbyreturn

# Renew loans via Libby
odmpy libbyrenew

# Download a book via an odm file to MyLoans/
odmpy dl -d "MyLoans/" "MyLoans/Book1.odm"

# Return Book1.odm
odmpy ret "MyLoans/Book1.odm"

# Get information about a loan Book1.odm
odmpy info "MyLoans/Book1.odm"

```

`odmpy` also supports the reading of command options from a file. For example:

```bash
odmpy libby @example.dl.conf

odmpy dl @example.dl.conf MyLoans/MyBook.odm
```
where [`example.dl.conf`](example.dl.conf) contains the command arguments values
